  <!--
    Check out the script tags below.
    Notice that we are already loading react and react-dom with script tags.
    Both are available in the global scope.

    The browser can't understand our react code in "/client/babel-src" because it includes JSX.
    Babel is a tool that will transform (referred to as 'transpile') the code into javascript
    that the browser can parse and run.

    Next, uncomment the 2 script tags for the react components below,
    then open your developer console in your browser and reload the page.
    Then come back here and keep reading.

    Notice how initially there are 404 errors, as the code in the "/compiled" folder doesn't exist, yet.
    We're going to use babel to "transpile" the code in "/client/babel-src" and output it in the "/compiled" folder.

    NEXT: open a new terminal tab and enter `npm run babel-hint`,
    then follow the instructions that will print in that terminal tab.
